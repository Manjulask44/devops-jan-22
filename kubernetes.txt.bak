Kubernetes Installation
	Minimum system requirement for master nod is 2-core cpu and 4GB RAM
	
	1. sudp apt update 
	2. sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
	3. sudo su -
	4. curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add
	5. echo 'deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
	6. sudo apt update 
	7. sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
	8. sudo systemctl start docker
	9. sudo systemctl enable docker.service
	9. sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl kubernetes-cni
	
	10. Create a ami from above instance to create workernodes 
	
	11. After ami is available, login again to master node 
		(Make sure docker is running)
		12. sudo su -
		13. kubeadm init
			ERROR1: if we get kubelet isn't running or healthy
						kubelet doesnt got access to docker engine which means 
						we need to configure cgroup of docker 
					create a file /etc/docker/daemon.json with below content
						{
							"exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
						}
					Reload docker daemon
						systemctl daemon-reload
						systemctl restart docker
						systemctl restart kubelet
					
			Run kubeadm init again	
			
			ERROR2: if we get fileavailable error just delete those files 
			ERROR3: if kubelet is running kill it 
						lsof -i :<kublet_port>
						kill -9 <process_id>
			
			Run kubeadm init again	
				if we get kubeadm join command at the end means master node 
				setup is successful and save the join command.

		14. configure K8S kubectl 		
			- exit from the root 
			- copy the default k8s conf file to our home directory 
					mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
					sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
					sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
		
		15. We install k8s CNI Driver
			sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1
			kubectl apply -f "https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/v1.13/net.yaml"
			
			check for node status - kubectl get nodes
		
		16.	Login to worker node 
			sudo su -
			create a file /etc/docker/daemon.json with below content
				{
					"exec-opts": ["native.cgroupdriver=systemd"]
				}
			Reload docker daemon
				systemctl daemon-reload
				systemctl restart docker
				systemctl restart kubelet		
				
			Now open ports of master nodes 
			
			Run the join command with token which we got from master node 
			
			Repeat the same steps in other worker nodes
			
kubernetes Architecture 	
	The architecture of k8s differs from master and worker node 

	Master node components 
		1. Api Server / kube-api-server
			- It is the main managemnet point of the cluster and also called 
			  as brain of the cluster.
			- All the components are directly connected to API serve, they 
			  communicate through API server only and no other component will 
			  communicate directly with eachother.
			- This is the only component which connects and got access to etcd.
			- All the cluster requests are authenticated and authorized by API server.
			- API server has a watch machanism for watching the changes in cluster.
			
		2. etcd 
			- ectd is a distributed , consistent key value store used for 
			  storing the complete cluster information/data.
			- ectd contains data such as configuration managemnet of cluster,
              distributed work and basically complete cluster information.			
			
		3. scheduler / kube-scheduler
			- The scheduler always watches for a new pod request and 
			  decides which worker node this pod should be created.
			- Based on the worker node load, affinity and anti-affiny, taint configuration 
			  pod will be scheduled to a particualr node.
			  
		Controller manager /control manager / kube-controller 
			- It is a daemon that always runs and embeds core control loops known as controllers. 
			- K8s has some inbuild controllers such as Deployment, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Replication controller,
			  node controller, jobs, cronjob, endpoint controller, namespace controller etc.	
			
		Cloud controller manager 
		
		
		
	Worker node components 
		kubelet 
			- It is an agent that runs on each and every worker node and it alsways watches the API 
			  server for pod related changes running in its worker node.
			- kubelet always make sure that the assigend pods to its worker node is running.
			- kubelet is the one which communicates with containarisation tool (docker daemon)
              through docker API (CRI). 	
			- work of kubelet is to create and run the pods. Always reports the status of the worker node 
			  and each pod to API server. (uses a tool call cAdvisor)
			- Kubelet is the one which runs probes.	
		
		kube service proxy 
			(in k8s service means networking)
			- Service proxy runs on each and every worker node and is responsble for watching API 
			  server for any changes in service configuration (any network related configuration).	
			- Based on the configuration service proxy manages the entire network of worker node.

		Container runtime interface (CRI)
			- This component initialy identifies the container technology and connects it to kubelet.
			
			
		pod
			- pods are the smallest deployable object in kuberntes.
			- pod should contain atleast one container and can have n number of containers.
			- If pod contains more than one container all the container share the same memory assigned to that pod.
			
			
YAML file 
	- Filetype .yaml / .yml 
	- YAML file will contain key value pairs where key is fixed and defined by the tool and value is 
	  user defined configuration. 
    - values supports multiple datatypes - string, Integer, Boolean, Array, List and dictionary.

	example:
		1)	name: Harsha
			hobbies: ["Driving","coding"]
			
				(or)
				
			name: harsha
			hobbies: 
				- Driving
				- coding
			
		2)  candidates: 
			   - name: a
			      firstname:
			      lastname: 	
			     age: 25
			   - name: b
			     age: 29
				 
example pod
	apiVersion: v1
		- This is used to specify the version of API t create a particular k8s object.
		- The field is casesentive, it will be in camelcase 
		- The types of API we have in k8s are alpha, beta and stable versions.
		
	kind: Pod 
		- used to specify the type of k8s object to create.
		- Always object name first letter is capital.
		
	metadata: 
		contains the information that helps us to uniquely identify the object.
		There are 3 types of metadata 
			1. name 
			2. labels 
				- k8s labels us used to identify the object.
				ex: name, evironment, tier, release.
			3. annotations

	spec: 
       - actual configuration of the objects 	
	   
	   
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod 
metadata: 
    name: my-first-pod	
spec: 
    containers:
       - name: my-nginx 
         image: nginx:latest
		 ports: 
		    - containerPort: 80
	
TO create / apply a configuration 
	kubectl apply -f <file>.yml	
	
To list objects 
	kubectl get <obeject_type>
		ex: List pods - kubectl get pods 
		    List deployment - kubectl get deployments
			
To delete objects 
	kubectl delete <object_type>


Assignment: What happens if we create a pod with kubectl ?
	
K8S Labels and selectors 
	- K8S labels is a metadata key value which can be applied to any object in k8s.
	- Labels are used to identify by using selectors.
	- Multiple objects can have same label, multiple labels to same object and Label lenght should be less that 63 characters.
	
	TO list all labels of a object 
		kubectl get <obeject_type> <obejct_name> --show-labels 
	
	
	Selectors 
		- Selectors are used to filter and identifly the labeled k8s object.
		
		Equality-Based 
			- It will use only one label in comparision and it will look for objects with exact same 
			  string in label.
			- we can use 3 types of operators equal ( = or == ) and not-qual ( != )	
		
			example: 
				selectors: 
					matchLabels: 
						app=nginx 
						   (or)
						app: nginx   
		
		set-based 
			- This type of selector allows us to filter objects based on multiple set of values to a label key.
			- 3 types of operators we can use in, notin and exists.

				example: 
					selectors: 
						matchLabels: 
							app in (nginx, my-nginx)
							app exits (nginx, my-nginx)
							app notin (nginx, my-nginx)
Annotations 
	- These are used for record purpose only and to provide some user information to objects.
	- These are non-identifying metadata so we cannot use selectors on annotations.

	example: personal_info, phone_number, imageregistry, author	
	
Assignment: Difference b/w set-based and equality-based selector.
			Difference b/w labels and annotations.

ReplicaSet vs Replication Controller
	- Both ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are alyways running at a given point of time.
	- Replication controller is a very old way of replicating the pos and now it is replaced by ReplicaSet
      
	- The only differenece b/w them is their selector types.
		Replication Controller supports only equality-based selector. 
		ReplicaSet supports both equality-based and set-based selectors.

Deployment controller / Deployment / k8s deployment 
	- Deployment is used to create replicas of pod and it makes sure at a given point of time 
	  the number of replicas of pod is alway running. 
	- Deployment internally uses ReplicaSet to replicate the pods.
	- If we update the configuration in deployment it will automatically updates it to all the pods.
	- Rollout and Rollback of pod update is possible.
	- we can pause a deployment whenerver we need.
	- Deployment has got its own internal autoscaller which is of type horizontal scaller. 
		To apply calling 
			kubectl autoscale deployment.v1.apps/<deployment_name> --min=5 --max=20 --cpu-percent=50	
	- scaleup and scaledown is possible by increasing and decreasing the replica count at any given 
	  point of time.
		kubectl scale deployment.v1.apps/<deployment_name> --replicas=10	
	
	- deployment is a cluster level object.
	
		deployment = pod + ReplicaSet + autoscaling + RollingUpdates 
	
	Deployment spec file.
		
		apiVersion: apps/v1
		kind: Deployment
		metadata:
		  name: nginx-deployment-new
		  labels:
			app: my-deployment-nginx
		spec:
		  replicas: 5
		  selector:
			matchLabels:
			  app=nginx
		  template:
			metadata:
			  labels:
				app: nginx
			spec:
			  containers:
			  - name: nginx
				image: nginx:1.14.2
				ports:
				- containerPort: 80
	
Assignment for me: demo on selectors types 
	
DaemonSet
	- DaemonSet ensures that a copy of pod is always running on all the worker nodes in the cluster.
	-If a new node is added or if deleted DaemonSet will automatically adds/deletes the pod.

	usage: 
		- we use DaemonSet to deploy monitoring agents in every worker node.
		- Log collection daemons: to grab the logs from worker and all the pods running in it.
		
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
	matchLabels:
	  app: daemonset-nginx
  template:
	metadata:
	  labels:
		app: daemonset-nginx
	spec:
	  containers:
	  - name: nginx
		image: nginx:1.14.2
		ports:
		 - containerPort: 80		
		 
Statefull Applications 
	- User session data is saved at the server side.
	- if server goes down, it is difficult to transfer the session data to other server. 
	- This type of application will not work, if we want to implement autoscalling.
	
Stateless Applications
	- user sessiondata is never saved at the server side.
	- using a common authentication gateway / client token method to validate the users 
	  once for multiple microservices.

Monolothic and Microservice architecture 

	Monolothic architecture
		- A monolothic application has a single code base with multiple moduels in it.
		- It is a single build for entire application.
		- To make minor changes to application, we need to re-build and re-deploy the 
		  complete application.
		- scalling is very challenging.
			
	Microservice architecture 
		- A microservice application is composed of small (micro) services. 
		- Each service will have a different code base.
		- Application are divided into as small as possible sub applications called services
		  which are independent to each other which are called loosly coupled.	
		- Each service can be managed seperately and it is deployable seperately.
		- Services need not to share same technology stack or frameworks.		 

StatefulSet 
	- StatefulSet = Deployment + sticky identity for each and every pod replica.
	- Unlike a deployment a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of the pod.
		
Node controller 
	- Looks for node statuses and reponds to API server only when a node is down.

Endpoint Controller
	- Populates the information of endpoints of all the objects.	
		
Service (svc)
	- Service is an REST api objects with set of policies for defining the 
	  access to set of pods.
	- Services are the default load balancer in k8s.
	- services are always created and works at cluster level.
	- services are the networking configurations which we do in k8s.
	- k8s prefers to use 30000 - 50000 range of ports to define services.

1. ClusterIP
	- This is the default type of service which exposes the IPs of pod to the other pods 
	  with in the same cluster.
	- ClusterIP cannot be accessed outside cluster.
	- services are the default loadbalancers of k8s.
	
	apiVersion: v1 
	kind: Service 
	metadata:
	     name: my-svc 
	spec: 
		type: ClusterIP
		selector: 
			app: my-nginx 
		ports: 
			- name: http
			  port: 30080
			  targetPort: 8080	

2. nodePort 
	- A nodeport service is the most primitive way to get the external traffic directed to our services / applications 
	  running inside a pod within the cluster.
	- By default NodePort acts as a load balancer. 
	- Automatically a ClusterIP will be created internally. 
	
		NodePort = ClusterIP + a port mapping to the all the nodes of cluster.
		
	- If we wont specify any port while creating nodeport, k8s will automatically asign a port between the range 30000 - 32767
	- By default nodeport will open the port in all the node in cluster including master node.	
	
	apiVersion: v1 
	kind: Service 
	metadata:
	     name: my-svc 
	spec: 
		type: NodePort
		selector: 
			app: my-nginx 
		ports: 
			- name: http
			  nodePort:30082	
			  port: 8080
			  targetPort: 80
			  
3. Load Balancer
	- It is a tyoe of service which is used to link exernatl load balancer to the cluster.
	- This type of serviec is used by cloud providers and this service is completely depends on cloud providers. 
	- K8s now proides a better alternative for this service type which is called Ingress.

How to use custom images / connect to a registry through k8s 
	1. Login to the docker hub account 
		  docker login 
	2. Create a app to print ip 
			using flask 
	3. 	push the image to your registry 
	4 use the above custom image in k8s spec file.
	
		image: <username>/<regirty_name>:<tag>
		imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
		
	5. Create a service of type NodePort attaching the above pods 
		
namespaces 
	- k8s namespaces is a way of applying abstraction / isolation to support multiple 
	  virtual clusters of k8s objects with in the same physical cluster.
	- Each and every object in k8s must be in a namespac.
	- If we wont specify namespace, objects will be created in default namespace of k8s.
    - namespaces are cluster level.
	- by default pods in same namespace can communicate with eachother.
	- Namespace are only hidden from eachother but not fully isolated because one 
	  service in a namespace can talk to another service in another namespace using 
	  fullname (service/<service_name>) followed by namespace name
	
	usage: we can apply environment based logical separation on cluster. 
		
	Type of deafault NS
	1. default
	   - This NS is used for all the objects which are not belongs to any other namespace.
	   - If we wont specify any namespace while creating an object in k8s then 
         that object will be created in deafult namespace.
			
	2. kube-system 
	   - This namespace is always used for objects created by the k8s system.
	   
	3. kube-public 
	   - The objects in this namespace are available or accessable to all.
       - All the objects in this namespace are made public.

	4. kube-node-lease 
	   - This namespace holds lease objects assosiated with each node.
	   - Node lease allows the kubelet to send heartbeats so that the control palne can 
		 detect node failure.
	
	To list namespace
		kubectl get namespaces 
	
	To list objects in a namespace 
		kubectl get pods --namepsace <NS_name> 
					(OR)
		kubectl get pods -n <NS_name> 
	
	To list obects from all namespaces
		kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
		
	To create a namespace 
		kubectl create namespace <ns_name>
		
	To create k8s object in a namespace 
		1. in the spec file 
			metadata: 
				namespace: <ns_name>
				
		2. Using the apply command 
			kubectl apply -n <ns_name> -f <spec>.yml
		
		Note: what if we use both inside specfile and also in apply command 
				- apply command check and compares the namespace and wont allow to create the obejct if the namespace is different.

Assignment: try exec to a pod 				
	
	- pod to pod communication is open if the 2 pods are in the same namespace.	
	- If the pods are in different namespace by default they can't communicate we need a service object for this.
	
	How a microservice will communicate with other microservice
	What is service discovery in k8s 
		
Servce Discovery 
	There are 2 ways of docovering a service 
		DNS 
		  - DNS server is added to the cluster in order to watch the k8s service requests.
		  - API server create DNS record sets for each new service.
		  - REcord A type is used in k8s service discovery and this DNS is created on service and pod objects.
		  
			syntax of DNS 
					<object_name>.<namespace_name>.<object_type>.<k8s_domain>
					
					ex: my-app-svc.default.svc.local 
					ex: my-app-svc.default.svc.example.com 
					
		ENV variables 
		  - which ever the pods that runs on a node, k8s adds environment variables for each of them to identify the service 
			running in it.
		  
		headless service 
		  - When we neither need nor want loadbalancig and a single IP point to a service, we need use headless service.
		  - Headless service returns all the ips of the pods it is selecting.
		  - headless serivce is created by specifing none for clusterIP 
		  - headless service is usually used with statefulsets.
		  
		apiVersion: v1 
		kind: Service 
		metadata:
			 name: my-svc 
		spec: 
			ClusterIP: none
			selector: 
				app: my-nginx 
			ports: 
				- name: http
				  port: 30080
				  targetPort: 80	
				  
		nodePort = headless + port mapping 		  
		
		apiVersion: v1 
		kind: Service 
		metadata:
			 name: my-svc 
		spec: 
			type: NodePort
			ClusterIP: none
			selector: 
				app: my-nginx 
			ports: 
				- name: http
				  nodePort:30082	
				  port: 8080
				  targetPort: 80		
				  
		1. Create a headless service with statefulsets
		2. Login to any one of pod 
		3. apt install dnsutils and do nslookup <service_name>	
		
pod phases / status / states / life cycle 
	1. pending 
		- This is the status of pod when pod will be waiting for k8s cluster to accept it.
		- pod will be downloading the image from registry.
		- pod wiil be in pending till the scheduler assigns a node to the pod.
	
	2. Running 
		- The pod has been assigned a node and all the containers inside the pod is running.
		- Atleast one container is in running state and others in starting or restarting state then pod will show 
		  running state.

	3. Failed 
		- All the container in the pod should not be running and any one container being terminated in failure.
		
	4. Succeeded 
		- ALl the containers in pod have been terminated successfully/gracefully.
		
	5. Unknown 
		- For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtaied by API server.
		- The status may occur when k8s cannot communicate with the kubelet or the worker node.
	
	
terminating 
	- when pod is being deleted.
	
container status 
	Running 
		- Means container is running the process inside without any error 
	Terminated
		- Process inside the container has completed the execution or may be failed due to some error.
	waiting 
		- If a container is not running or neither in terminated state.
	
Common errors
	ImagePullBackOff 
		- Docker image registry is not accessible.
		- Image name / tag version specified is incorrent.
	CrashLoopBackOff
        - We get this error when probe check has failed.
		- Docker image may be faulty.
	RunContainerError 
		- Configmap / secrets are missing. 
		- Volumes are not available 
		
		
k8s volumes 
	persistent volume (pv)
		- It is a storage space which can be claimend to any pod in the cluster.
		- These are cluster level object and not bound to namespace.
		
		we can control the access to volume in 3 ways:
			- ReadOnlyMany(ROX) allows being mounted by multiple nodes in read-only mode.
			- ReadWriteOnce(RWO) allows being mounted by a single node in read-write mode.
			- ReadWriteMany(RWX) allows multiple nodes to be mounted in read-write mode.
		
		Note: If we need write access to volume from multiple pods scheduled in mulitple nodes then use ReadWrtieMany
		
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: PersistentVolume
	metadata:	
		name: my-pv
		labels: 
			volume: test
	spec: 
		storageClassName: local 
		accessModes: 
			- ReadWriteOnce
		capacity: 
			storage: 2Gi
		hostPath: 
		    path: "/home/ubuntu/my-pv-volume" 
			   
	Persistent volume claim (pvc)
		- This is the object used to claim / mount the required amount of storage from persistent volume to any 
		  pod in the cluster.
		- After we create the PersistentVolumeClaim, the Kubernetes control plane looks for a PersistentVolume that 
		  satisfies the claim's requirements. 
		- If the control plane finds a suitable PersistentVolume with the same StorageClass, it binds the claim to the volume.
	
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
	metadata:	
		name: my-pvc
	spec: 
		storageClassName: local 
		accessModes: 
			- ReadWriteOnce
		resources: 
		    requests:
                storage: 1Gi 
        	
	using this in a pod 
	
	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Pod 
	metadata: 
		name: my-pvc-pod	
	spec: 
        volumes: 
		    - name: pvc-volume
			  persistentVolumeClaim: 
			       claimName: my-pvc # This name should be same the PVC object name
		containers:
		   - name: my-nginx 
			 image: nginx:latest
			 ports: 
				- containerPort: 80
			 volumeMounts: 
			    - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
				  name: pvc-volume # This name should be same as the above volume name 

			   
pod patterns / container types
	init containers 
		- init containers are the containers that will run completely before starting 
		  the main app container.
		- This provides a lifecycle at the startup and we can define things for 
          initialization purpose.
        - kubernetes has stopped support of probes in init containers.
        - These are pod level objects.
	    - we can use this container to have some deply on the startup of the main container.
	
	These are some of the scenarios where you can use this pattern
		- You can use this pattern where your application or main containers need some
		  prerequisites such as installing some software, database setup, permissions on the file
		  system before starting.
		- You can use this pattern where you want to delay the start of the main containers.

	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Pod 
	metadata: 
		name: init-container	
	spec: 
		containers:
		   - name: my-nginx 
			 image: nginx:latest
			 ports: 
				- containerPort: 80
		initContainers: 
		   - name: busybox
		     image: busybox 
			 command: ["/bin/sh"]
	         args: ["-c","echo '<html><h2>THis is a init container</h2></html>' >> /work-dir/index.html"]
		     volumeMounts: 
		       - name: workdir
		         mountPath: "/work-dir"
		volumes: 
           - name: workdir
             emptyDir: {}		   
		
		1. login to pod 
				kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/sh 
		2. apt update && apt install -y curl 
		3. curl localhost
			
		To check the log of particular container out of multiple in a pod 
			kubectl logs <pod_name> -c <container_name>
		
	Sidecar container 
		- These are the containers that will run along with the main app container.
		- we have a app conaitner which is working fine but we want to extend the 
		  functionality without changing the existing code in main container for this 
          purpose we can use sidecar container.
        - we use this container to feed the log data to monitoring tools.	
		
		These are some of the scenarios where you can use this pattern
			- Whenever you want to extend the functionality of the existing single container pod without
			  touching the existing one.
			- Whenever you want to enhance the functionality of the existing single container pod
			  without touching the existing one.
			- You can use this pattern to synchronize the main container code with the git server pull.
			- You can use this pattern for sending log events to the external server.
			- You can use this pattern for network-related tasks.

	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Pod 
	metadata: 
		name: init-container	
	spec: 
		containers:
		   - name: my-nginx 
			 image: nginx:latest

	Adaptor container 
		- In this patter we use a sidecar container to feed the log data to a monotoring 
		  tool.
	
	https://www.magalix.com/blog/kubernetes-patterns-the-ambassador-pattern
	
probes 
	- probe is a periodic call to some applciation endpoints within a container.
	- probes can track success or failure of the other applications.
	- When there is a subsequent failure occures we can defie probe to get triggered.
	- when subsequent success after a failure we can define probe to get triggered.
	- probes works at container level.
	
	Common fields in probes 
		initialDelaySeconds
			- After the container has started the number of seconds to wait before the probe os triggered.
		periodSeconds 
			- The number of seconds interval the probe should be executed. (Default 10 seconds and minimum 1 second)
		timeoutSeconds 
			- Number of seconds after which probe timeouts. (default 1)
			
		failureThreshold
			- When a probe fails this is the number of subsequent fail times the probe checks the status of application.
			- After the number of subsequent failure then probe fails.
			- Default value 3 
		
		successThreshold 
			- minimum number of subsequent success for a probe. 
			- Default value is 1
			
		Endpoints 
			http probes (httpGet)
				host - hostname to conenct and probe will check the status of this hostname 
				     - Default is the IP of current pod 
					 ex: www.google.com
				path - exact path to access the application on the http server 
					 ex: /gmail
				httpHeaders
					- can send custom header messages with the request.
				port 
					- Name or number of the port to access the application 
					
			TCP probes 
				port 
					- Name or number of the port to access the application
			
			exec 
				commad 
				  - we execute a command and check its status.
		
Liveness probe 
		- The livenessprobe is used to determine if the applciation inside the container 
		  is healthy or needs to be restarted.	
		- If livenessprobe fails it will mark the container to be retarted by kubelet.
		
	1. LivenessPRobe with http 
		
		apiVersion: v1
		kind: Pod 
		metadata: 
			name: liveness-http	
		spec: 
			containers:
			   - name: liveness 
				 image: k8s.gcr.io/liveness
				 args:
					- /server
				 livenessProbe:
				    httpGet:
				  	   path: /healthz
				  	   port: 8080
				    initialDelaySeconds: 3
				    periodSeconds: 3	
		
	2. TCP 
		livenessProbe:
			tcpSocket:
			   port: 8080
			initialDelaySeconds: 3
			periodSeconds: 3
	3. exec 
		livenessProbe:
			exec:
			   command: ["",""]
			initialDelaySeconds: 3
			periodSeconds: 3
	
	4. named port 
		ports: 
			- name: liveness-port 
			  containerPort: 8080
              hostPort: 8080
		livenessProbe:
			httpGet:
			   path: /healthz
			   port: liveness-port
			initialDelaySeconds: 3
			periodSeconds: 3			
	
Readiness Probe 
	- ReadinessProbe is used to determine that a application running inside a 
	  container is in a state to accept the traffic.
    - When this probe is successful, the traffic from the loadbalancer is allowed 
	  to the application inside the conatiner.
	- When this probe is fails, the traffic from the loadbalancer is halted
	  to the application inside the conatiner.
	readinessProbe: 
		tcpSocket: 
			port: 8080
		initialDelaySeconds: 15
		periodSeconds: 10
		
Startup Probe 
	- This probe will run at the initial start of the container.
	- This probe allows us to give maximum startup time for application before 
	  running livenessProbe or readinessprobe.
	  
	startupProbe: 
	    httpGet: 
		   path: /healtz
		   port: 8080
		initialDelaySeconds: 3
	    periodSeconds: 3   

Assigment: create livenessProbe and readinessprobe with tcp, http, exec 	
	
RBAC 	
	How user access is maintained in k8s ?
	
	Role-Based access control
		- accounts 
		- Roles 
		- Binding of roles 
		
	Accounts 
		There are 2 types accounts in k8s 
		
		1. USER ACCOUNT 
		   It is used to for human users to control the access to k8s cluster.
		
		2. SERVICE ACCOUNT 
		   - It is used to give access to k8s cluster to external tools/applications and 
		     also to give access to other components inside the cluster.
           - Any application running inside or outside the cluster need a service account 
             to access API server.		   
		   - When a SA is created, first k8s creates a token and keeps that token in a secret object 
             and then the secret object is linked to the service account.
		
		To list service account 
			kubectl get sa 
			kubectl get serviceaccounts 

		To create SA
			kubectl create serviceaccount <service_account_name>
				
			Note: To check screte object of sa
					kubectl describe secrets <secret_name>
		
		Attach a SA to pod
				
		apiVersion: v1
		kind: Pod 
		metadata: 
			name: sa-pod	
		spec: 
			serviceAccountName: my-sa
			containers:
			   - name: liveness 
				 image: k8s.gcr.io/liveness
				 args:
					- /server
				 livenessProbe:
				    httpGet:
				  	   path: /healthz
				  	   port: 8080
				    initialDelaySeconds: 3
				    periodSeconds: 3		
		
	Roles 
		- For a user roles are the set of rules which defines the access level to 
		  k8s resources. 
		- Roles are always user defined to any type of account.
		- Roles works at namespace level.
		
		comman fiels in roles 
			apiGroups: List the api groups to control the access to a account.
			Subject: Users, service_account or Groups
			Resources: K8S objects on which we want to define this role 
					ex: Pods, Deployments etc..
			Verbs: The operations/actions that a user can perform in k8s cluster
				["get","list","create","update","delete","watch","patch"]	
		
		Create a role 
			apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
			kind: Role
			metadata:
			  namespace: default
			  name: pod-reader
			rules:
				- apiGroups: "*"
				  resources: ["pods"]
				  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
	
		To create role in cli 
			kubectl create role <role_name> --resource=pods --verb=list -n <namespace>
	
	ClusterRole 
		- It is a cluster wide role which is a non-namespaced object.
		- CR defines permissions on namesapce objects and it grants permissions across all the
		  namespaces or individual namespace also.
	
		usage: 
			If we need to define permissions inside a namesapce use Roles. 
			If we need to define permissions at cluster wide use ClusterRole
			
		Create a role 
			apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
			kind: ClusterRole
			metadata:
			  name: cluste-role-pod-reader
			rules:
				- apiGroups: "*"
				  resources: ["pods"]
				  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]			
	
	
	RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding 
		- Role bindind as name indicates is used to bind roles to subjects (user, sa , groups)
		- Cluster Role bindind is used to bind cluster roles to subjects (user, sa , groups)
		
		- we can user rolebinding to bind clusterrole to a role of a particular namespace.
		
		
	RoleBinding
		apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
		kind: RoleBinding
		metadata:
		   name: my-role-binding
		   namespace: default
		roleRef:
		   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
		   kind: Role
		   name: pod-reader # the name of role we want to attach the account.
		subjects: 
           - kind: ServiceAccount
			 name: my-sa # the name of account need to attached to role 
			 namespace: default 	
	
	To check the roles affect 
		kubectl auth can-i list svc --as=system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<service_account> -n <namepsace>
		
		ex: kubectl auth can-i list svc --as=system:serviceaccount:default:my-sa -n default

	ClusterRoleBinding
		apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
		kind: ClusterRoleBinding
		metadata:
		   name: my-cluste-role-binding
		roleRef:
		   apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
		   kind: ClusterRole
		   name: <cluster_role_name> # the name of cluster role we want to attach the account.
		subjects: 
           - kind: ServiceAccount
			 name: my-sa # the name of account need to attached to role 
			 namespace: default

How to create/schedule a pod to a particualr work node? 
How not to create a pod on a node ?

node selector
	- Node selector is a way of binding pods to a particular worker node based on labels given 
	  to that node.
	- Logical expresions type of selection cannot be achived in node selector.
	
	To label a node 
		kubectl label node <node_name> <key>=<value>
	
Node Afinity and anti-afinity (Inter-pod affinity)
	- Node selector with logical expresions is Affinity 
	- Using node afinity we can spread pods accross worker nodes based on 
	  CPU and RAM capacity (memory-intense mode), Availabilty zones (HA mode).
	
	- requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution 
		The scheduler can't schedule the Pod unless the rule is met.	
	- preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution 
		The scheduler tries to find a node that meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, 
		the scheduler still schedules the Pod in normal way.
    - IgnoredDuringExecution 
		if the node labels change after Kubernetes schedules the Pod, the Pod continues to run.	

		
	spec: 
			containers: 
			affinity: 
			   podAntiAfinity: 
	              preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
				     labelSelector:
					    - matchExpressions: 
							 - key: env
                               operator: in 
                               values: 
                                  - test
                                  - prod								  

									 
Anti-Afinity (Inter-pod affinity)
	- This is used to define whether a given pod should or should not be scheduled on a particular node 
      based on labels.
	  
		spec: 
			containers:
			  ....
			ifNotPresent: 
                nodeSelector: 
					env: test
					
		spec: 
			containers: 
				...
			affinity: 
				podAntiAfinity: 
                 	requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
						- labelSelector:
                            - matchExpressions: 
                                - key: env 
                                  operator: in 
                                  values: 
                                     - test 
                                     - qa				

Taints and Tolerations
	- Taints are used to repel the pods from a specific worker node.
    - We can apply taint ti worker nodes which tells scheduler to repel all pods expcet the pods 
	  with toleration defind in it for the taint.
	- only the pos with toleration define in it for the taint of worker node. 
       
	- 2 operators we can use Equal and Exists (If we use Exists, no value required)   
	- Bellow are the effects we can use,
		1) NoSchedule - This taint means unless a pod with toleration k8s won't be able 
           to schedule a pod to tainted node.		
		2) NoExecute - To delete all the pods except some required pods we can use this. 
		
		To taint a worker node 
			kubectl taint nodes <node_name> <taint_key>=<taint_value>:<taint_effect>
			
		To remove the taint (use - at the end)
			kubectl taint nodes <node_name> <taint_key>=<taint_value>:<taint_effect>-
			
		To add tolerations
				(single toleration with Equal)
			spec: 
				tolerations: 
					- key: "key1"    
					  operator: "Equal"
					  value: "value1"
					  effect: "NoSchedule"
			
				(single toleration with Exists)
			spec: 
				tolerations: 
					- key: "key1"    
					  operator: "Exists"
					  effect: "NoSchedule"
					  
				(multiple tolerations)
			spec: 
				tolerations: 
					- key: "key1"    
					  operator: "Equal"
					  value: "value1"
					  effect: "NoSchedule"
					- key: "key2"    
					  operator: "Equal"
					  value: "value2"
					  effect: "NoExecute"	
					  
configMap and secrets 
	- Configmap are k8s object that allows us to separate the configuration data/files from the 
	  image content of the pod.
	- Using this we can keep the configurations of application portable and same configuration
	  can be used in multiple pods.
	- configmaps are used for non-confidential data.	
		
	Create a configmap 
		1. Create a file by name "app.properties" 
				environment=test
				database_url="192.168.10.9"
		2. Create configmaps 
			a. load the single config file 
				kubectl create configmap <configmap_name> --from-file configs/app.properties
		
			b. load the multiple config file
				kubectl create configmap <configmap_name> --from-file configs/
				
		3. using configmaps in pod 
			spec: 
				containers: 
				   - name: nginx 
				     image: nginx 
					 env: 
					    - name: CURRENT_NAME
						  valueFrom: 
							  configMapKeyRef: 
									name: <configmap_name>
									key: environment

Secrets 
	- secrets are used for confidential data.
	- k8s by default uses base-64 encoding method to encrypt the data.
	
	type 
		Opaque - for user related data in base64 
		service account token - kubernetes.io/service-account-token 
		docker cofig - kubernetes.io/dockercfg 
		
			
	1. get the encoded values 
		echo "production" | base64	
			output: cHJvZHVjdGlvbgo=
	2. use the above encoded value in secret 
		apiVersion: v1
		kind: Secret
		metadata:
			name: my-secret
		type: Opaque
		data:
			environment: cHJvZHVjdGlvbgo=
	
	3. using secrets in pod 
			spec: 
				containers: 
				   - name: nginx 
				     image: nginx 
					 env: 
					    - name: CURRENT_NAME
						  valueFrom: 
							  secretKeyRef: 
									name: <secret_name>
									key: environment	

resource limits and quotas
	How to limit the number of pod to a namespace ?
	How to limit the memory to a pods ? 	

	Count quota 
		- we use k8s quotas to precisely specify the number of objects a user can work with.
		- we can define quotas for the below objects 
			count/persistentvolumeclaims
			count/services
			count/secrets
			count/configmaps
			count/replicationcontrollers
			count/deployments.apps
			count/replicasets.apps
			count/statefulsets.apps
			count/jobs.batch
			count/cronjobs.batch
			
		Applying the resource quota for an object (count quota)
			apiVersion: v1 
			kind: ResourceQuota 
			metadata: 
			    name: count-quota 
			spec: 
				hard: 
					pods: "2"
					   or 
					count/pods: "2"  
					
		Applying quotas for CPU, RAM, DISK SPACE
			apiVersion: v1 
			kind: ResourceQuota 
			metadata: 
			    name: ram-quota 
			spec: 
				hard: 
					request.memory: "500Mi" 
					limits.memory: "800Mi"

	Limitations 
		CPU 
			- 1 cpu, in k8s is equal to 1 core/cpu 100%.
			ex:  0.1 cpu - 10 % of 1 cpu - 1 gpu - 1 hyperthread - 1 Nueral 
		
		Memory 
			- It will be in terms of bytes 
			- It should fixed numebrs always 
			syntax: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki
			
		using quotas in pod 
			spec: 
				containers: 
				   - name: nginx 
				     image: nginx 
					 resources:
					    requests: 
						   memory: "500Mi"
						   cpu: 0.5
						limits:
                           memory: "1Gi"
                           cpu: 1		
	
	Note: In terms of cpu k8s doesnot go behind the limits (it never throttles).
		  but in terms of memory (RAM) k8s allows the pods to go behind the limit of RAM
